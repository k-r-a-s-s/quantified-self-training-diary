# Quantified Self

Code repository for quantified self code including Daylio, Fitbit, Training Diary updating in to centralised google sheet.

Automation of daylio output was achieved using tasker autoinput.
Fitbit output uses php script running on localhost
EliteHRV uses screenshot and OCR

Code is a few years old now (circa-2019) and some APIs are probably open now and don't require such workarounds as needed in this project.
